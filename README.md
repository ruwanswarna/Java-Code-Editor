# Code Editor for Java Programmers
<br>


## This is a code editor specially designed for programming with Java language.

We designed this program's UI based on Eclipse IDE. Even if this isn't as advanced as Eclipse, it has some key features like;
- Opening multiple files with Tabs UI structure
- Project explorer sidepane for easy access to projects and files
- creating boilerplate code through shortcuts on the menubar
- changing some of the look and feel through preferences
<br>

## We mainly did this proect as a coursework for our Programming Data Structures and Algorithms Module.

Here we have utilized stacks as well as linked lists to implement undo and redo functionality of the editor.
